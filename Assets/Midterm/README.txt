Check the drive for detailed midterm instructions

In the folder named "ExamplesOfMidterms" there are scenes that are examples of different kinds of midterm submission:
- "AllCodeExampmle", a midterm submission that doesnt fulfill the game design requirement
- "AllGameDesignExample", a midterm submission that doesnt implement any mechanics
- "GoodExample", a midterm submission that implements 2 mechanics with game design

Note: the scripts in the "ExamplesOfMidterms" folder you are free to use but to count as an implemented mechanic they need to substantial changes

Things I implemented:
- Changing Scene Block
- Hazard Obstacle that when the player steps on, deals damage overtime 
- Health System (Player can take and recover health)
- Player has a dash skill and the dash skill has a cooldown
- Player can jump, but cannot jump for than once while in the air (no double jump)
