How To Play the Game:

Left Arrow Key/A Key - Move Left
Right Arrow Key/D Key - Move Right
Spacebar - Jump
Left Shift - Dash

Goal: 
Walk, Jump, and Dash your way through a platform world until you reach a purple block.

Mechanics I created:

I rewrote the movement system so the player can move left and right, jump, dash, and wall jump. I created cubes that, when the player collides with them, switch them to a selected scene, creating a flow from level to level. In addition, I made a consumable that gives back health when touched. Furthermore, I created a firepit containing a fireball (that moves up and down) in which the player takes consecutive damage until they die; when the player touches and remains on them, the player takes consecutive damage until they die. When they die, the player is taken to a game over screen, and the player has to restart from the beginning, adding to the difficulty. In the same turn, when the player reaches the end and touches a purple block, they are taken to the win screen and can play again.
